# Introduction-to-Quantum-Computing
Exploring Qiskit, an open-source python framework for creating a program that runs on an IBM Quantum Computer.

# About
This is my first attempt at exploring quantum computing by following a [youtube series](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPCZcv-5qfA&feature=emb_logo).
This repository contains code and supporting comments on fundamentals of Quantum programming using the Qiskit framework. My code covers defining qubits to be used, drawing circuits, testing out circuit gates such as the not gate, controlled not gate and Hadamard's gate, and simple rotational gates to see quantum superposition and entanglement in action. 

The python code was written in Quantum Lab on the [IBM's Quantum Experience website](https://quantum-computing.ibm.com/). Accessing the IBM Quantum services from Qiskit locally would require a token which can be obtained from the [website](https://quantum-computing.ibm.com/). Follow the links below to learn about getting started and the tutorial links I followed to run my first program on a Quantum Computer.
